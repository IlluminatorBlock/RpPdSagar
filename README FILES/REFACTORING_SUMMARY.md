# System Refactoring Summary
**Date:** October 5, 2025  
**Purpose:** Clean up codebase, optimize report generator, implement role-based report folders, verify architecture

---

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. **Report Generator Optimization** ✅
**File:** `utils/report_generator.py`

**Changes:**
- **Removed 226 lines** of unused code
  - Deleted `_parse_rag_response()` method (never called)
  - Deleted 8 helper methods: `_extract_field()`, `_extract_medical_history()`, `_extract_past_medical_history()`, `_extract_symptoms()`, `_extract_test_results()`, `_extract_medications()`, `_extract_allergies()`, `_extract_lifestyle_factors()`
  - These methods were legacy code from when RAG queries were parsed manually
- **Removed unused imports:**
  - `A4` (page size not used)
  - `cm`, `mm` (units not used)
  - `Frame`, `CondPageBreak` (platypus elements not used)
  - `TableOfContents` (not implemented)
  - `Drawing`, `Rect`, `Line`, `String` (graphics shapes not used)
  - `HorizontalLineChart`, `VerticalBarChart`, `Pie` (charts not implemented yet)
  - `Tuple` (type hint not needed)

**Results:**
- Line count: **2561 → 2335 lines** (9% reduction)
- File size: More maintainable and focused
- Backup created: `report_generator_BACKUP_2532_LINES.py`

**What's Left:**
- All essential report generation functions
- Patient data collection methods (admin/doctor workflows)
- Comprehensive PDF creation with medical standards
- ICD-10 coding, Hoehn & Yahr staging
- Professional formatting and styling

---

### 2. **Simple Report Generator Removal** ✅
**File:** `utils/simple_report_generator.py`

**Status:** 
- ✅ File exists but is **NOT imported anywhere**
- ✅ Only `MedicalReportGenerator` is used throughout the system
- ✅ No cleanup needed - can be deleted if desired (kept as reference)

---

### 3. **Import Cleanup Verification** ✅
**File:** `main.py`

**Verified Imports:**
- ✅ `asyncio` - Used 8 times (async operations, event loops)
- ✅ `logging` - Used throughout for system logging
- ✅ `signal` - Used for graceful shutdown handling
- ✅ `sys` - Used for path manipulation and stdout
- ✅ `uuid` - Used 6 times for generating unique IDs
- ✅ `Optional, Dict, Any` - Used in type hints
- ✅ `Path` - Used for file path handling

**Result:** All imports in main.py are actively used. No cleanup needed.

---

### 4. **Role-Based Report Folder Structure** ✅
**Files:** `utils/file_manager.py`, directory structure

**New Folder Structure:**
```
data/
└── reports/
    ├── admin/
    │   └── drafts/        # Admin drafts with timestamp
    ├── doctor/            # Doctor-created reports
    └── patient/           # Patient reports
```

**Changes Made:**

1. **Created Physical Folders:**
   - `data/reports/admin/drafts/`
   - `data/reports/doctor/`
   - `data/reports/patient/`

2. **Updated `file_manager.py`:**
   
   **`_ensure_base_structure()` method:**
   ```python
   # OLD:
   'reports/drafts',
   'reports/doctors',
   'reports/patients',
   
   # NEW:
   'reports/admin/drafts',  # Admin drafts
   'reports/doctor',         # Doctor reports
   'reports/patient',        # Patient reports
   ```

   **`get_report_storage_path()` method:**
   - **Admin reports:** `reports/admin/drafts/draft_{timestamp}.pdf`
     - All admin reports go into drafts with unique timestamps
   - **Doctor reports:** `reports/doctor/{patient_id}_report_{timestamp}.pdf`
     - Doctor reports include patient ID in filename
   - **Patient reports:** `reports/patient/{patient_id}_report_{timestamp}.pdf`
     - Patient reports include patient ID in filename

   **`ensure_patient_structure()` method:**
   - Removed: `reports/patients/{patient_id}/` subdirectory
   - Reports now go directly into `reports/patient/` folder

   **`ensure_doctor_structure()` method:**
   - Removed: `reports/doctors/{doctor_id}/` subdirectory
   - Reports now go directly into `reports/doctor/` folder

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Clean separation by role
- ✅ Easy to find reports by user type
- ✅ Admin drafts are isolated from final reports
- ✅ Timestamps prevent filename conflicts

---

### 5. **Database & Shared Memory Verification** ✅
**Files:** `core/database.py`, `core/shared_memory.py`

**Verified Features:**

**`database.py`:**
- ✅ Proper async operations with `aiosqlite`
- ✅ Foreign key constraints enabled (`PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON`)
- ✅ Comprehensive schema (users, doctors, patients, reports, embeddings, etc.)
- ✅ Proper connection context manager (`DatabaseConnection`)
- ✅ Migration support with `_migrate_database()`
- ✅ Embeddings manager integration
- ✅ Clean separation: `init_database(initialize_embeddings=False)` for loading only

**`shared_memory.py`:**
- ✅ Event bus for agent communication
- ✅ Event subscription system with callbacks
- ✅ Async event processing queue
- ✅ Action flag management
- ✅ Session data coordination
- ✅ Background cleanup tasks

**Key Methods Verified:**
- `get_connection()` - Returns context manager with foreign keys
- `get_embeddings_manager()` - Returns loaded embeddings (not created)
- `_initialize_embeddings_on_demand()` - Only called during setup
- `_load_existing_embeddings()` - Loads pre-existing embeddings

**Result:** Database and shared memory are properly structured and functional.

---

### 6. **Embeddings Creation Verification** ✅
**Files:** `init_database.py`, `main.py`, `core/database.py`

**Verified Flow:**

1. **Initial Setup (Run Once):**
   ```bash
   python init_database.py
   ```
   - Calls `database.init_database(initialize_embeddings=True)`
   - Creates embeddings from documents in `data/documents/`
   - Stores embeddings for future use

2. **Regular Usage (Every Run):**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   - Calls `database.init_database()` (defaults to `initialize_embeddings=False`)
   - Only **loads** existing embeddings via `_load_existing_embeddings()`
   - **DOES NOT CREATE** new embeddings

**Key Code in `database.py`:**
```python
async def init_database(self, initialize_embeddings: bool = False) -> None:
    """Initialize database
    Args:
        initialize_embeddings: If True, create embeddings (use only during setup)
    """
    # ... table creation ...
    
    if initialize_embeddings:
        # ONLY runs during init_database.py
        embeddings_success = await self._initialize_embeddings_on_demand()
    else:
        # ALWAYS runs in main.py - just loads existing
        await self._load_existing_embeddings()
```

**Result:** ✅ Embeddings are created ONCE during setup, not on every run.

## 🔄 Role-Based Report Flow

### **Admin Workflow:**
```
Admin creates report
    ↓
file_manager.get_report_storage_path(user_role="admin")
    ↓
Saves to: data/reports/admin/drafts/draft_20251005_143022.pdf
```

### **Doctor Workflow:**
```
Doctor creates report for Patient P123
    ↓
file_manager.get_report_storage_path(user_role="doctor", patient_id="P123")
    ↓
Saves to: data/reports/doctor/P123_report_20251005_143022.pdf
```

### **Patient Workflow:**
```
Patient P123 generates own report
    ↓
file_manager.get_report_storage_path(user_role="patient", patient_id="P123")
    ↓
Saves to: data/reports/patient/P123_report_20251005_143022.pdf
```
