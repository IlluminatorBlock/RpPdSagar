# Session 3 Summary - Comprehensive Report Retrieval System

**Date:** December 2024  
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETED

---

## What Was Requested

The user requested a convenient report retrieval system that supports multiple querying methods:

1. âœ… Get reports by patient ID
2. âœ… Get reports by MRI scan file
3. âœ… Admin dashboard showing all doctors, patients, and monitoring statistics
4. âœ… Doctor dashboard showing assigned patients and their reports

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Methods Added (core/database.py)

#### `get_reports_by_patient_id(patient_id: str)`
- **Lines:** 914-926
- **Purpose:** Retrieve all reports for a specific patient
- **SQL:** Joins `medical_reports` with `sessions` on patient_id
- **Returns:** List of report dictionaries sorted by date

#### `get_reports_by_mri_scan(mri_file_path: str)`
- **Lines:** 928-942
- **Purpose:** Retrieve reports associated with an MRI scan
- **SQL:** Joins `medical_reports` with `mri_scans` via session_id
- **Returns:** List of report dictionaries for that scan

#### `get_admin_dashboard()`
- **Lines:** 944-1023
- **Purpose:** Comprehensive system overview for administrators
- **Returns:** Dictionary with:
  - `summary`: Total counts (doctors, patients, reports, active sessions)
  - `doctors`: List of doctors with patient/session counts
  - `patients`: List of patients with report/session counts
  - `recent_reports`: Last 10 reports generated

#### `get_doctor_dashboard(doctor_id: str)`
- **Lines:** 1025-1080
- **Purpose:** Doctor-specific dashboard with assigned patients
- **Returns:** Dictionary with:
  - `doctor_info`: Complete doctor profile
  - `statistics`: Total patients, sessions, active sessions
  - `patients`: Assigned patients with report/session counts
  - `recent_reports`: Last 20 reports for assigned patients

## Database Schema Relationships Used

```
patients.assigned_doctor_id â†’ doctors.doctor_id
  â””â”€ Links patients to their assigned doctors

sessions.patient_id â†’ patients.patient_id
sessions.doctor_id â†’ doctors.doctor_id
  â””â”€ Links sessions to patients and doctors

medical_reports.session_id â†’ sessions.id
  â””â”€ Links reports to sessions

mri_scans.session_id â†’ sessions.id
  â””â”€ Links MRI scans to sessions
```

---

## Key Features

### âœ… Flexibility
- Multiple ways to access reports (by patient, by scan, by role)
- Different views for different user types
- Easy to extend with new methods

### âœ… Performance
- Optimized SQL with proper JOINs
- Uses existing indexes (patient_id, doctor_id, session_id, created_at)
- Efficient aggregation and grouping
- Minimal database round-trips

### âœ… Security Ready
- Parameterized queries prevent SQL injection
- Easy to add role-based filtering
- Clear separation of data access logic

### âœ… Maintainability
- Centralized database logic
- Well-documented with examples
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Clear naming conventions

---

## Usage Examples

### Get Reports by Patient ID
```python
db = DatabaseManager(DATABASE_PATH)
reports = await db.get_reports_by_patient_id("PAT123")
```

### Get Reports by MRI Scan
```python
reports = await db.get_reports_by_mri_scan("data/mri_scans/scan_001.jpg")
```

### Get Admin Dashboard
```python
dashboard = await db.get_admin_dashboard()
print(f"Total Patients: {dashboard['summary']['total_patients']}")
```

### Get Doctor Dashboard
```python
dashboard = await db.get_doctor_dashboard("DOC123")
print(f"Assigned Patients: {dashboard['statistics']['total_patients']}")
```

---

## Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
python test_report_queries.py
```

Expected output:
- âœ… Test 1: Patient report retrieval
- âœ… Test 2: MRI scan report retrieval  
- âœ… Test 3: Admin dashboard
- âœ… Test 4: Doctor dashboard

## Integration Points

These methods can be integrated into:

1. **Main Application Flow**
   - Use in RAG agent for context gathering
   - Use in report generation for historical data

2. **Authentication/Authorization**
   - Admin users get full dashboard
   - Doctors get filtered dashboard
   - Patients get their own reports only

3. **Web/CLI Interface**
   - Display dashboard data in UI
   - Allow report filtering and search
   - Export reports functionality

4. **Analytics and Monitoring**
   - Track system usage
   - Monitor doctor workload
   - Identify trends and patterns
